Data ingestion benchmark for 100 million samples/sec and 1 billion of active time series.

Cluster setup:

- vmstorage: 46 nodes, each 15.6vCPU, 55GB RAM, 2200GB HDD-based persistent disk
- vminsert: 18 nodes, each 15.6vCPU, 55GB RAM
- vmselect: none

Total resources:
- vmstorage: 717.6vCPU, 2.53TB RAM, 100TB disk
- vminsert: 280.8vCPU, 1TB RAM

32 Kubernetes nodes: e2-standard-32, autoscaling node pool

Total: 1024vCPU, 4TB RAM, 100TB disk

Resource usage during the benchmark:

- vmstorage: 510vCPU avg, 600GB RAM avg
- vminsert: 206vCPU avg, 26GB RAM avg
- disk IO: 3GB/s write avg, 400 MB/s read avg
- network: 140gbit/s avg

Benchmark stats:
- scrape targets (node_exporter v1.4.0): 820K
- active time series: 1 billion
- data ingestion rate: 100 million samples/sec
- total datapoints stored: 100M*3600*24=8.64 trillions
- disk space usage:
- the average sample size: 

Specific tuning:

- vminsert:
  - add -rpc.disableCompression option in order to reduce CPU usage at the cost of higher network usage
